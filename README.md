# Proj2

Completed the requirements for Exceeds for this one, as I only did Meets on the first project.

Successfully paginated the given list, and appended the links at the bottom without too much trouble.

Added search functionality for both typing and clicking the search button.

Ran through the 44, 54, and 64 student lists, and all worked for me, with the initial list, as well as the searched list.

Set it up so when the search box is cleared out, it shows the original list.
